# Comprehensive Explanation: download_renesas_schematics.py

## Overview
The `download_renesas_schematics.py` script is a web scraping automation tool designed to download PDF schematic files from Renesas Electronics' documentation website. It uses Selenium WebDriver to handle dynamic content loading, Cloudflare protection, and automated file downloads, then organizes the downloaded files with clean naming conventions.

## Architecture and Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Browser automation for handling dynamic web content
- **Chrome WebDriver**: Headless Chrome browser for PDF downloads
- **CSV Processing**: Reading and parsing schematic metadata from CSV files
- **Pathlib**: Cross-platform file path handling
- **Requests**: HTTP requests (imported but not used in current implementation)
- **Shutil**: File operations for moving and renaming downloaded files

### External Requirements
- **Chrome Browser**: Must be installed on the system
- **ChromeDriver**: Selenium WebDriver for Chrome (automatically managed by Selenium 4+)
- **CSV Data Source**: `schematics_links.csv` containing schematic metadata

## Detailed Function Analysis

### 1. `setup_selenium()` Function

**Purpose**: Configures and initializes a headless Chrome WebDriver with optimized settings for PDF downloads.

**Detailed Logic**:
```python
def setup_selenium():
    chrome_options = Options()
    chrome_options.add_argument('--headless')
    chrome_options.add_argument('--no-sandbox')
    chrome_options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')
    chrome_options.add_argument('--disable-gpu')
    chrome_options.add_argument('--window-size=1920,1080')
    chrome_options.add_argument('--user-agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36')
    
    # Set download directory to the schematics folder in current directory
    download_dir = str(Path("schematics").absolute())
    chrome_options.add_experimental_option("prefs", {
        "download.default_directory": download_dir,
        "download.prompt_for_download": False,
        "download.directory_upgrade": True,
        "plugins.always_open_pdf_externally": True
    })
    
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)
    return driver
```

**Key Features**:
- **Headless Operation**: Runs without GUI for server environments
- **Security Bypass**: Disables sandbox and dev-shm-usage for containerized environments
- **PDF Handling**: Configures Chrome to automatically download PDFs instead of displaying them
- **Download Directory**: Sets the schematics folder as the default download location
- **User Agent Spoofing**: Uses a realistic user agent to avoid detection

**Why This Matters**: The configuration ensures reliable PDF downloads while avoiding common Selenium issues like permission errors and browser detection. The headless mode allows the script to run on servers without display capabilities.

### 2. `get_current_pdf_files()` Function

**Purpose**: Creates a snapshot of existing PDF files in the download directory with their modification timestamps.

**Detailed Logic**:
```python
def get_current_pdf_files(download_dir):
    """Get list of current PDF files in the directory with their timestamps"""
    files = {}
    for file in os.listdir(download_dir):
        if file.endswith('.pdf'):
            files[file] = os.path.getmtime(os.path.join(download_dir, file))
    return files
```

**Key Features**:
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Records modification times for change detection
- **PDF Filtering**: Only tracks PDF files, ignoring other file types
- **Dictionary Structure**: Maps filenames to timestamps for easy comparison

**Why This Matters**: This function enables the script to detect newly downloaded files by comparing before/after snapshots, which is crucial for automated file handling.

### 3. `get_new_downloaded_file()` Function

**Purpose**: Identifies the newly downloaded file by comparing before and after file snapshots.

**Detailed Logic**:
```python
def get_new_downloaded_file(before_files, after_files):
    """Find the new file that was downloaded"""
    new_files = {f: t for f, t in after_files.items() if f not in before_files}
    if not new_files:
        return None
    return max(new_files.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
```

**Key Features**:
- **Change Detection**: Compares file lists to find new additions
- **Timestamp Selection**: Selects the most recently modified file if multiple new files exist
- **Error Handling**: Returns None if no new files are detected

**Why This Matters**: This function solves the challenge of identifying which file was downloaded when Chrome's default naming is unpredictable (often generic names like "document.pdf").

### 4. `clean_filename()` Function

**Purpose**: Sanitizes schematic titles to create valid, clean filenames for downloaded PDFs.

**Detailed Logic**:
```python
def clean_filename(title):
    """Clean the title to make it a valid filename"""
    # Remove any invalid characters
    invalid_chars = '<>:"/\\|?*'
    for char in invalid_chars:
        title = title.replace(char, '')
    # Replace commas and spaces with underscores
    title = title.replace(',', '_').replace(' ', '_')
    # Remove any double underscores
    while '__' in title:
        title = title.replace('__', '_')
    return title.strip('_')
```

**Key Features**:
- **Character Sanitization**: Removes Windows/Unix invalid filename characters
- **Space Handling**: Converts spaces and commas to underscores
- **Duplicate Cleanup**: Removes consecutive underscores for cleaner names
- **Edge Case Handling**: Strips leading/trailing underscores

**Why This Matters**: Schematic titles often contain special characters and spaces that are invalid in filenames. This function ensures downloaded files have clean, accessible names while preserving readability.

### 5. `download_schematics()` Function

**Purpose**: Main orchestration function that processes the CSV file, downloads PDFs, and handles the complete workflow.

**Detailed Logic**:
```python
def download_schematics():
    # Create schematics directory if it doesn't exist
    schematics_dir = Path("schematics")
    schematics_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    
    # Read the CSV file
    with open("schematics_links.csv", "r", encoding='utf-8') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        rows = list(reader)
    
    # Filter rows to only include PDF files
    pdf_rows = [row for row in rows if row.get('Format', '').strip().upper() == 'PDF']
    
    print(f"Found {len(rows)} total schematics")
    print(f"Found {len(pdf_rows)} PDF schematics to download")
    
    # Setup Selenium driver
    driver = setup_selenium()
    
    successful_downloads = 0
    failed_downloads = []
    
    try:
        for row in pdf_rows:
            title = row['Title'].strip()
            url = row['URL'].strip()
            
            # Clean the title to make it a valid filename
            filename = clean_filename(title) + '.pdf'
            file_path = schematics_dir / filename
            
            # Skip if file already exists
            if file_path.exists():
                print(f"Skipping {filename} - already exists")
                successful_downloads += 1
                continue
            
            print(f"\nProcessing: {title}")
            print(f"URL: {url}")
            
            try:
                # Get list of files before download
                before_files = get_current_pdf_files(str(schematics_dir))
                
                # Navigate to the PDF URL
                driver.get(url)
                
                # Wait for Cloudflare challenge to complete
                try:
                    WebDriverWait(driver, 30).until(
                        EC.presence_of_element_located((By.TAG_NAME, "body"))
                    )
                except TimeoutException:
                    print("Timeout waiting for Cloudflare challenge")
                    failed_downloads.append((title, url, "Cloudflare timeout"))
                    continue
                
                # Wait a bit for the page to fully load
                time.sleep(5)
                
                # The PDF should start downloading automatically
                # Wait for the download to complete
                time.sleep(10)
                
                # Get list of files after download
                after_files = get_current_pdf_files(str(schematics_dir))
                
                # Find the newly downloaded file
                downloaded_file = get_new_downloaded_file(before_files, after_files)
                if not downloaded_file:
                    raise Exception("No new PDF was downloaded")
                
                # Rename the downloaded file to the cleaned title
                downloaded_path = schematics_dir / downloaded_file
                if downloaded_path.exists():
                    shutil.move(str(downloaded_path), str(file_path))
                    print(f"Successfully downloaded and renamed: {filename}")
                    successful_downloads += 1
                else:
                    raise Exception(f"Downloaded file not found at {downloaded_path}")
                
                # Add a small delay between downloads
                time.sleep(random.uniform(2, 5))
                
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error downloading {title}: {str(e)}")
                failed_downloads.append((title, url, str(e)))
                continue
    
    finally:
        driver.quit()
    
    # Print summary
    print("\nDownload Summary:")
    print(f"Total schematics: {len(rows)}")
    print(f"PDF schematics: {len(pdf_rows)}")
    print(f"Successfully downloaded: {successful_downloads}")
    print(f"Failed downloads: {len(failed_downloads)}")
    
    if failed_downloads:
        print("\nFailed Downloads:")
        for title, url, error in failed_downloads:
            print(f"Title: {title}")
            print(f"URL: {url}")
            print(f"Error: {error}\n")
```
